# Article "You can’t replace Redux with Hooks and Context"

This repository contains a single article of my blog post, exposed as a micro-frontend.

**Why?**

The article includes rich, interactive elements that rely on low-level MDX APIs. These APIs were available in older versions of MDX, but they’ve since changed or been removed in newer versions.

Rather than rewriting the entire article to work with the latest MDX setup, it’s packaged here as its own build. This way, the article can be integrated into the main blog without compatibility issues or major refactoring.
